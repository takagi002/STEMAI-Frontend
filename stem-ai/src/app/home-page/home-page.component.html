        <h1>What is STEM-AI?</h1>
        <mat-card-content class="letters">
            STEM-AI is your new personal recommender. It sees what
            classes you are struggling in and recommends you tutoring while you
            can still improve your grade. Our algorithm takes data from past
            students in your class, sees how tutoring improved their grade,
            and recommends tutoring for you. We work closely with the STEM
            Center and your professors to provide you the help you need. Your
            Professors will also be able to identify when you are struggling in
            a class earlier in the course. When they see you struggling,
            they can send you an email recommending you get tutoring. With the
            help of STEM-AI, everyone can identify early on when to get help and
            from that we can connect you with tutors.
