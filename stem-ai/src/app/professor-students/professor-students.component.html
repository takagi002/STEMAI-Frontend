                    Each panel represents a student in your class. 
                    The checkbox on the left of the pannel is how you select 
                    students in order to send them emails recommending 
                    tutoring. If the checkbox is not selectable, that student
                    has not signed up with STEMAI and therefore cannot receive 
                    emails from us. The numbers beside the checkbox is the students
                    id number. The checkbox on the right side of the panel
                    shows whether the algorithm recommends tutoring for said student.
                    If the algorithm recommends tutoring that checkbox will be checked, 
                    otherwise the checkbox won't be checked. The question mark icon 
                    besides the checkbox explains why the checkbox is checked as well. 
                    You can use the buttons at the end of the screen to send emails to 
                    selected students by selecting the checkbox on the left side of the 
                    pannel and clicking the button Send Selected. If you want to send an 
                    email recommending tutoril to all students you can click the Send All button.
