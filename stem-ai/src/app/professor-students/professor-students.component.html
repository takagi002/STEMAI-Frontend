    <p class="greytext">Each panel represents a student in your class.
      The checkbox on the left of the panel is how you select
      students in order to send them emails recommending
      tutoring. If the checkbox is not selectable, that student
      has not signed up with STEM-AI and therefore cannot receive
      emails from us. The numbers beside the checkbox is the students
      id number. The checkbox on the right side of the panel
      shows whether the algorithm recommends tutoring for said student.
      If the algorithm recommends tutoring that checkbox will be checked,
      otherwise the checkbox won't be checked. The question mark icon
      besides the checkbox explains why the checkbox is checked as well.
      You can use the buttons at the end of the screen to send emails to
      selected students by selecting the checkbox on the left side of the
      panel and clicking the button Send Selected. If you want to send an
      email recommending tutorial to all students you can click the Send All button.</p>
